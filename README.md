# Blockchain Voting DApp

A decentralized voting application that enables secure and transparent participation in polls using Ethereum smart contracts. Users can log in with MetaMask or Gmail (which creates a secure BIP39-based wallet) and vote on live proposals. Admins have special privileges to create and delete proposals.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be utilized to facilitate secure, tamper-proof, and transparent voting. Each user is restricted to a single vote per proposal, with all votes being recorded immutably on the Ethereum blockchain. Admins can create and delete proposals through an on-chain dashboard.

**Status:** Still in active development. UI and contract logic may continue to improve.

## Features

- MetaMask and Gmail login integration
- BIP39 wallet generation for Gmail users
- Admin-controlled proposal creation and deletion
- One vote per user per proposal (on-chain enforced)
