# Blockchain Voting DApp

A decentralized voting application that enables secure and transparent participation in polls using Ethereum smart contracts. Users can log in with MetaMask or Gmail (which creates a secure BIP39-based wallet) and vote on live proposals. Admins have special privileges to create and delete proposals.

- BIP39 wallet generation for Gmail users
- Proposal creation and deletion (admin-only)
- One-vote-per-user enforcement
- Real-time results display
- Responsive design with dark UI
- Hosted on Netlify, connected to Sepolia via Alchemy
